# Multiclass-Classification-Model-Machine-Learning

- Train a multiclass classification model. Perform EDA and try to understand the data especially the traits of each class, preprocess the data, train, evaluate the model and analyze the results!
  
- XGBoost is a boosting algorithm based on tree-based models. It has a mechanism to display 3 types of feature importance: (1) gain, (2) weight, & (3) coverage. Explain each of them
